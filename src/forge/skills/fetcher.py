"""Git ref SHA resolution and repository cloning for skill fetching.

Uses ``git ls-remote`` to resolve branch/tag refs to their exact commit SHAs.
When a ref resolves to nothing (empty output), the ref is assumed to already
be a commit SHA and ``None`` is returned.

Provides :func:`clone_skill_package` to clone a repository into a temporary
directory, using a shallow clone for speed and falling back to a full clone
when the ref is a commit SHA or when the shallow clone fails.  The
:func:`clone_context` context manager wraps the clone and guarantees cleanup.

Provides :func:`should_fetch_entry` to compare a resolved SHA against the
current lock file and determine whether a re-fetch is needed.
